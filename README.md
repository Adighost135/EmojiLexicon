# Emoji Lexicon — Static Site

This repository hosts the **Emoji Lexicon (Version 1.5)** as a static website.  
All visualizations and data assets are located in the `docs/` folder and are served directly as a static site (e.g., through GitHub Pages).

## About

This site was created as part of my thesis research while affiliated with the **Computational Linguistics Laboratory (CeLT)** at **De La Salle University (DLSU)**.

The dataset used to develop the lexicon and visualizations was collected from **Twitter**.

## Citation / Attribution

If you need changes to the wording, a more formal citation format, acknowledgements, or academic phrasing, feel free to request an update.
