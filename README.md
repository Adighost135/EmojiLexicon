Emoji Lexicon — Static Site

This website showcases the Emoji Lexicon (version 1.5) that I created for my thesis. The visualizations and data assets live in the `docs/` folder and are served as a static site.

About
- This site was created as part of my thesis research while I'm affiliated with the De La Salle University (DLSU) CeLT lab.
- The dataset used to build the lexicon and visualizations was collected from Twitter.

If you want any wording changes (more formal attribution, citation format, or extra acknowledgements), tell me and I will update this file.
